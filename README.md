# 🧱 Governance Contract — Foundry Deployment & Testing

This repository contains a **Foundry-based setup** for the governance smart contract shown in the  
[Smart Contract Programmer YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dF9le0T6mdc).

It is a **fork** of the original repository that hosts all Solidity tutorials from the channel,  
but this fork replaces the old example code with **deployment scripts** and **comprehensive tests** built for Foundry.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **Foundry workflow** for Solidity development — from writing and testing to deployment and verification.

### Key Features

- ✍️ Governance and token smart contracts (`Governance.sol`, `MyToken.sol`)
- ⚙️ Deploy scripts for multiple environments (Anvil, Sepolia)
- 🧪 Unit tests for all proposal and voting functions
- 🧰 Foundry cheatcodes (`vm.prank`, `vm.warp`, `vm.deal`, etc.)

The repository serves as a practical learning and testing environment for governance mechanisms in Solidity.
